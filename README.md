# Cyclistic Data Analysis README

Hey there! This analysis is an optional case study from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. 📊 Let's dive into it in a more conversational tone and make it super easy to read!

## Introduction

This case study is like the grand finale of the Google Data Analytics Certification Course 🏆. It's where I put on my junior data analyst hat and work on a real-world project for a made-up company called Cyclistic. 🚴‍♀️ They've got over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. We got our hands on data from a real bike share company called [Divvy](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). 🚲

## About The Company

So, Cyclistic started back in 2016 and hit it big with their bike-share program. They've got 5,824 bicycles cruising around Chicago, all tracked and locked into 692 stations. You can grab a bike from one station and drop it off at another anytime you want. 🌆

Before, Cyclistic mainly focused on getting the word out and attracting a wide range of customers. They had different pricing plans like single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. People who went for the single-ride or full-day passes were called casual riders, while the annual membership folks were Cyclistic members.

Now, the finance folks at Cyclistic crunched some numbers and found out that annual members bring in more moolah than casual riders. So, they want to grow that annual membership base. 📈 Instead of going all out for new customers, they think there's a good chance to turn those casual riders into annual members. Makes sense, right? Casual riders already know Cyclistic.

So, our mission is clear: Design marketing strategies that get casual riders to become annual members. To do that, we need to understand how these two groups differ and why casual riders would want to go annual. We're also looking at how digital media can help in our marketing game plan. 📣

## Scenario

I'm part of the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, and our big boss is Lily Moreno, the director of marketing. Lily's in charge of all those cool campaigns and initiatives to promote Cyclistic, from emails to social media and more. 📧📱

## Business Task

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Data Source

The data we're working with covers rider info from August 2021 to July 2022. We got the data from Motivate International Inc. 🗂️ You can check out the data license [here](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). The data is split into different CSV files for each month of the year.

## Conclusion

Now, let's wrap it up! 🎁 The graphs tell us that subscribers use the bikes pretty much every day for a short time. Annual Members, on the other hand, ride for longer but less often during the week, and they love Saturdays. 📈🚴‍♀️ Subscribers use Cyclistic for their daily routines, while customers are all about leisure and fun.

## Key Recommendations

1. Stick some ads at the top 20 bike stations where customers usually book from. Also, hit those high-traffic spots in the city where people work, go to school, or hang out. 🏙️

2. Get creative on social media with a fun skit that appeals to people of all ages. That's gonna boost engagement and pique curiosity, leading to more subscribers. Oh, and toss in a quick survey question in the ad to gather some valuable data! 📢📋

3. Since customers love weekends, offer a special weekend-only subscription. Once they're hooked, entice them to upgrade to an annual subscription with a sweet deal. 🎉

There you have it, our game plan to turn those casual riders into loyal Cyclistic members! 🚀
